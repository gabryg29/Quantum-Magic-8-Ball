# Quantum-Magic-8-Ball
A beginner-friendly project to build a **quantum Magic 8 Ball** with Qiskit.   Unlike classical pseudo-randomness, quantum measurements are **inherently probabilistic**, making this a great way to explore **true randomness** and why it matters for simulations and cryptography.
