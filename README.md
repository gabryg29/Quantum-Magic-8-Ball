# Quantum Magic 8 Ball (Qiskit 1.x)

A beginner-friendly project to build a **quantum Magic 8 Ball** with Qiskit.  
Unlike classical pseudo-randomness, quantum measurements are **inherently probabilistic**, making this a great way to explore **true randomness** and why it matters for simulations and cryptography.

---

## What this project does

- Prepares a 3-qubit circuit in **equal superposition** (Hadamard on each qubit).
- Measures the qubits to obtain a **3-bit random string** (0–7).
- Maps the result to one of 8 Magic 8 Ball responses.

##  Why quantum randomness?

Classical randomness is often simulated by deterministic algorithms. Quantum mechanics, however, yields **irreducible randomness** upon measurement, which can enhance unpredictability in programming, variability in simulations, and strengthen cryptographic protocols.

## ⚙ Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (recommended)  
- Qiskit 1.x  
- (Optional) IBM Quantum account if you want to run on cloud backends
